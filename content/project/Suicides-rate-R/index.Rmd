# Load data ------------------

```{r}

                        suicides_rate = `suicides/100k pop`,

# Load extra data for worldmaps and statistics

## For world map

```{r}
library(maps)

world <- map_data("world")
world[world$region == "Antigua" | world$region == "Barbuda",]$region <- "Antigua and Barbuda"
world[world$region == "Cape Verde",]$region <- "Cabo Verde"

```

## For statistics

- Get area

- Get continents

- Get country codes

Might not be a good idea 

```{r}
# library(wbstats)

# wbcountries() %>% view()

# Searching area indicator in the database
# wbsearch(pattern = "area") 

#wb <- wb(country = "all", indicator = "AG.SRF.TOTL.K2", startdate = 1985, enddate = 2016) %>% 
 # rename(year = date) %>% 
#  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
#temp <- left_join(countrystat, wb, by = c("country" = "country", "year" = "year"))

#countries <- wbcountries()

#temp %>% filter(is.na(iso3c)) %>% view()

```


# Data Exploratory ----------------------- 

## Have a look

```{r}
summary(data)
```

- country-year column is just a concatenation of country and year column

- suicides/100k pop is calculated by suicides / population * 100000

- HDI is Human Development Report, seems missing alot, the only variable is missing

- Age is divided into brackets

## A closer look:

```{r}

skim_with(numeric = list(hist = NULL))
skim(data) 

```

There are:

- 6 Age brackets

- 101 differenet countries in this data set

- Year from 1985 to 2016. (32 years)

- 2321 combinations of country-year (less than 32 * 101). Must be some implicit missing data with year and country

- 6 different generations

- 2 Sex

## Extract country stats

HDI, GDP per year and per capital are values based on country so it makes sense to extract those values into another 
dataframe

```{r}
countrystat <- data %>% select(country, year, gdp_yearly, gdp_capita, HDI) %>% 
  distinct()

data <- data %>% select(-gdp_yearly, -gdp_capita, -HDI, -`country-year`)

```


## Review implicit missing data

```{r}
data <- data %>% complete(country, year, sex, age)
```

Pattern of missing data

```{r}
data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% 
  summarise(miss = sum(is.na(suicides_no))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% count(miss)
```


So each country every year can either miss all data, have all data, but there are some country only miss 2 data, Let's review those

```{r}
data %>% filter(year == 2016) %>% right_join(data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% 
  summarise(miss = sum(is.na(suicides_no))) %>% 
  filter(!miss %in% c(0,12)), by = c("country", "year")) %>% 
  filter(is.na(suicides_no))
```

Data from 2016 are missing with age group 5-14 years old

Let's find out how many missing data with each country each year

```{r}
data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% summarise(avg_rate = mean(suicides_rate)) %>% summarise(n = sum(is.na(avg_rate))) %>% arrange(desc(n))
  
```

Plot on map


```{r}
suicides <- data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% summarise(suicides_rate = mean(suicides_rate))

world <- map_data("world")



worldmap + suicides %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise(n = sum(is.na(suicides_rate))) %>% left_join(world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%  
  geom_polygon(data = ., aes(fill = n))  + scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "log2")
```

Most of the data are from Russia, America nand Europe. There are some countries that have a lot of missing data

Missing pattern
```{r}
data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% summarise(na = sum(is.na(suicides_no))) %>% filter(na > 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_tile(aes(year, country))
```

There are a lot of random missing data between all

Hierachical clustering

```{r}
temp <- data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% summarise(na = sum(is.na(suicides_no)))
```


## What is generation's age range?

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
data %>% filter(!is.na(generation)) %>% 
  separate(age, into =c("min", "max")) %>% mutate(max = ifelse(max== "years", 100, max)) %>% 
  mutate(min = as.integer(min), max = as.integer(max)) %>% 
  mutate(min = year - min, max = year - max) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(generation, min, color = "Max possible birth year"), alpha = 0.3) + geom_jitter(aes(generation, max, color = "Min possible birth year"), alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c("green", "red")) + theme(legend.position = "top") + ylab("Birth year")
```

- Since Age values are not provided but put in the age range, we can only estimate the actual year birth.

From the data, birth year of :

- G.I generation is aroung 1900

- Silent generation is around 1925

- Boomers generation is around 1955

- Generation X is around 1975

- Millennials is around 1980

- Generation Z is around 2000

Compare to Wiki

- G.I generation birth year is from 1900s to late 1920s

- Silent generation birth year is from late 1920s to mid 1940s

- Boomers generation birth year is from 1946 to 1964

- Genration X birth year is from early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s

- Millennials birth year is from early 1980s to early 2000s

- Generation Z birth year is from 1990s till now

There is no big discrepancy between data set and Wiki, no outliner either, so it is safe to assume that there is no mistake in our data.

# Analyze

## Suicides rate by year

Suicides rate per country per year of all recorded country visualized in boxplot.
The number on top shows number of countries recorded in each year.


```{r}
data %>% filter(!is.na(suicides_rate)) %>% 
  group_by(country, year) %>% 
  summarise(suicides_rate = sum(suicides_no)/sum(population)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(year) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year))) + geom_boxplot(aes(y = suicides_rate )) + geom_text(aes(label = n, y = 0.0006))
```


### By countries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
country_gif <- data %>% 
    group_by(country,year) %>% summarise(n = sum(suicides_no)) %>% filter(!is.na(n)) %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(year, n, color = country)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + transition_reveal(year)

anim_save("country_gif.gif", country_gif)
```

### By continents

## Suides rate by year and Age group

### By countries

### By continents

## GDP

No relation ship between GDP and suicide rate

```{r}
data %>% group_by(country, year) %>% 
  summarise(suicides_rate = sum(suicides_no)/sum(population)) %>% 
  left_join(countrystat, by = c("country", "year")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdp_capita, suicides_rate)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

Suicides rate per country per year




# From 2010

```{r}
worldmap + data %>% filter(year >= 2010 & year < 2016) %>%
  group_by(country) %>% summarise(n = sum(suicides_no)) %>% filter(!is.na(n)) %>% 
  left_join(world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%  
  geom_polygon(data = ., aes(fill = n))  + scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "log10")
```



# Without year

Fit model to predict Suicide rate based on gdp, pop, area

# Year

Population?

# Finland

```{r}
data %>% filter(country == "Finland") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(suicides_no)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(year, suicides_no, color = fct_reorder2(age, year, suicides_no))) +
  geom_line(aes(year, suicides_no, colour = age)) + facet_wrap(~sex)

```


# By gender

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, country) %>% 
  summarise(n0 = mean(suicides_no, na.rm = T)/mean(population, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(year), n0, color = sex)) + geom_boxplot()
```
