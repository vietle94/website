# Intro

This is the analysis I used to create the prediction for Kaggle competition. The purpose of the analysis is to use machine learning to predict the survival probability of people on the Titanic. The dataset is provided as follow:

- Dataset is divided into train and test set.

- Passenger's information such as Name, Age, Pclass, etc. is provided in both train and test set

- The outcome (survival) indicates whether that passenger has survived or perished. This only presents in the training set.

- There are some missing value in both data set

By using different machine learning algorithm, predictions can be made for people on the test dataset. In this project, I used a variaty of methods, some are just blackbox, some can be visualized fully or partially.

                    Embarked = col_factor()
                  ))

```


# Data exploration

First glimpse at our data

```{r, cache = T}
glimpse(train0)
```

We can see that:
- PassengerID is just a sequence of number to distinguish passengers, hence it has no predictive power.

- Name follows a pattern with Familyname, Title and Firstname, it shows a potential to extract those components

- SibSp and Parch: aren't those in the same family have the same familyname? Possibly have a relationship with family name

- Ticket does not follow any obvious pattern

- A lot of missing values in Cabin

## Dealing with NA

How many NA values?

- in train set

```{r, cache = T}
train0 %>% map_df(~sum(is.na(.)))
```
- in test set
```{r, cache = T}
test0 %>% map_df(~sum(is.na(.)))
```

Dealing with NA:

- Remove Cabin as there are too much NA

- Using median for Fare, only 1 value is missing

- Using the highest frequency value for Embarked

- The only predictor relating to Age is Name (Title e.g Mr, Miss, etc), so missing Age is replace by the mean of Age of people with the same title.

- Other methods like knnImpute or BagImpute or even some models which can handle NA values can be used to impute. However, those seems unnecessary complicated methods since they consider all other predictors to find NA values, We certainly know that only some predictors are directly relating predictors with missing NA.

## Visualization

### Fare

```{r ,message=F, warning=F, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
p1 <- train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(Fare, fill = Survived)) + labs(title = "Histogram of Fare \nin relation with Survived")
p2<- train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(Fare, fill = Survived), position = "fill") + labs(title = "Percentage of Fare \nin relation with Survived")
p1 + p2

```

Distibution of Fare is skewed to the right, transform it with log10 to normalize

```{r ,message=F, warning=F, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
p1 <- train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(log10(Fare+1), fill = Survived)) + labs(title = "Histogram of Fare \nin relation with Survived")
p2<- train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(log10(Fare+1), fill = Survived), position = "fill") + labs(title = "Percentage of Fare \nin relation with Survived")
p1 + p2
```

There is a patern in Fare in relation with Survived. More expensive ticket, higher chance to Survive (to an extend).

<br>

Good predictor

### Pclass

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(fct_relevel(Pclass, "1", "2"), fill = Survived)) + scale_x_discrete(name = "Pclass")
```

Pclass 1 > Pclass 2 > Pclass 3 in survival rate and there are much more people in Pclass 3 than Pclass 1 and 2.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(fct_reorder(Pclass,Fare), Fare)) + scale_x_discrete(name = "Pclass")
```

The cost of Ticket increases from PClass 3 (cheapest) to Pclass 1 (most expensive).

<br>

This makes sense as the upper class who stayed in Pclass 1 would have more money hence have better chance to survive.

<br>

Good predictor

### Sex

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
train0 %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(Sex, fill = Survived))
```

Female have better survival rate as women and children are usually being rescued first.

<br>

Good predictor

# Data transformation

## Combine test and train for feature selection

```{r, cache = T}
combined <- bind_rows(train0, test0)

```

## Recode survive for caret train as 1 and 0 are not valid level name in R

```{r, cache = T}
combined$Survived <- fct_recode(combined$Survived, "Lived" = "1", "Died" = "0") %>%
  fct_relevel("Lived")

```


## Extract Title

```{r, cache = T}
combined <- combined %>% mutate(Title = str_extract(Name, ", (\\w)+")) %>%
  mutate(Title = str_extract(Title, "\\w+"))

```

## Remove those title different from Miss, Master, Mr and Mrs since they are low frequency

```{r, cache = T}
combined %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(Title))
```

Then combine them into Others

```{r, cache = T}
combined <- combined %>%
  mutate(Title = ifelse(Title %in% c("Miss", "Master", "Mr", "Mrs"), Title,"Others"))

```

How this Title predictor look

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
combined[1:intrain,] %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(Title, fill = fct_relevel(Survived, "Died"))) + labs(fill = "Survived")
```
Good predictor.
<br>
In combination with Pclass, we can see a more detail picture.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, cache = T}
combined[1:intrain,] %>%
    group_by(Title, Pclass, Survived) %>%
    summarise(each = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(Title, Pclass) %>% mutate(Tot = sum(each)) %>%
  mutate(Survivalrate = each/Tot) %>%
  ungroup() %>% filter(Survived == "Lived") %>%
  ggplot() + geom_tile(aes(fct_relevel(Pclass,"1","2"), fct_relevel(Title,"Master", "Miss", "Mrs", "Mr"), fill = Survivalrate)) + scale_fill_viridis_c() + xlab("Pclass") + ylab("Title")
```


## Make Missingage predictor before we impute Age
```{r, cache = T}
combined <- combined %>% mutate(MissingAge = is.na(Age))

```

## Use Title to predict Age

Master are underage male children(Fact).
Take mean Age from train set and use it to replace NA from all data with Master title

```{r, cache = T}
meanMasterAge <- combined %>%
  slice(1:dim(train0)[1]) %>%
  filter(Title == "Master") %>%
  summarise(mean(Age, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull()
combined <- combined %>%
  mutate(Age = ifelse(Title == "Master" & is.na(Age), meanMasterAge ,Age ))
```

 Impute Age based on other Title

```{r, cache = T}
combined[is.na(combined$Age) & combined$Title == "Mr",]$Age <- mean(combined[1:intrain,][combined[1:intrain,]$Title == "Mr",]$Age, na.rm = T)
combined[is.na(combined$Age) & combined$Title == "Miss",]$Age <- mean(combined[1:intrain,][combined[1:intrain,]$Title == "Miss",]$Age, na.rm = T)
combined[is.na(combined$Age) & combined$Title == "Mrs",]$Age <- mean(combined[1:intrain,][combined[1:intrain,]$Title == "Mrs",]$Age, na.rm = T)
combined[is.na(combined$Age) & combined$Title == "Others",]$Age <- mean(combined[1:intrain,][combined[1:intrain,]$Title == "Others",]$Age, na.rm = T)
```

## Impute Embarked by median

```{r, cache = T}
combined[is.na(combined$Embarked),]$Embarked <- "S"

```

## Impute Fare by mean

```{r, cache = T}

combined[is.na(combined$Fare),]$Fare <- mean(combined[1:intrain,][combined[1:intrain,]$Pclass == 3,]$Fare, na.rm = T)
```

## Family name

```{r, cache = T}

combined <- combined %>% mutate(Familyname = str_extract(Name, "^.+,")) %>%
  mutate(Familyname = str_sub(Familyname,1, -2))

```

## Transform Fare to log(Fare)

```{r, cache = T}
combined <- combined %>% mutate(Fare = log10(Fare +1))

```

## Make groupsize predictor

A. There are people with same Ticket but different Family name
B. There are people with same Familyname but different Ticket
C. There are people with same Familyname and same Ticket

The groupsize of a person is determined by number of other people with same ticket and family name. (A + B - C)


```{r, cache = T}

combined <- combined %>% group_by(Ticket, Familyname) %>% mutate(nAll = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(Ticket) %>% mutate(nTicket = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(Familyname) %>% mutate(nFamilyname = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% mutate(Groupsize = nTicket + nFamilyname - nAll)

combined <- combined %>% select(-nTicket, -nFamilyname)

```

How this new groupsize predictor look

```{r, cache = T}
combined[1:intrain,] %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(Groupsize, fill = fct_relevel(Survived, "Died")), position = "fill")

combined[1:intrain,] %>%
    group_by(Pclass,Groupsize, Title, Survived) %>%
    summarise(each = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(Pclass, Groupsize, Title) %>% mutate(Tot = sum(each)) %>%
  mutate(Survivalrate = each/Tot) %>%
  ungroup() %>% filter(Survived == "Lived") %>%
  ggplot() + geom_tile(aes(fct_relevel(Title, "Master", "Miss", "Mrs"), Groupsize, fill = Survivalrate)) + scale_fill_viridis_c() + xlab("Title") + ylab("Groupsize") + facet_wrap(.~fct_relevel(Pclass, "1", "2"))
```
Some pattern but not really clear.

## Final look

```{r, cache = T}
glimpse(combined)

```


# Training

## Separate train and test set since we are done with Data transformation

Separate 20% of the train set into holdout set to evaluate the models, it is more convenient than using using upload test set to Kaggle everytime.

```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(12345)
notinholdout <- createDataPartition(train0$Survived, p = 0.8, list = F)

alltrain <- combined[1:intrain, ]

train <- combined[1:intrain, ] %>% slice(notinholdout)
holdout <- combined[1:intrain, ] %>% slice(-notinholdout)

test <- combined[-(1:intrain), ]
```


## Validation folds

5 times repeated 10 folds is used to evaluate model's parameters. It is usually specified inside the trainControl but separate this step is a requirement for caretEnsemble to make sure all folds are consistent for ensemble.

```{r, cache = T}

index <- createMultiFolds(train$Survived, k = 10, times = 5)

```

## Traincontrol

The index will take over other parameters, supply them just to get the labels right. We will use the metric ROC for this, so twoClassSummary and classProbs must be specified

```{r, cache = T}

trCtr_grid <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 5,
                           number = 5,
                           index = index, savePredictions = "final", summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
                           search = "grid", # By default  
                           verboseIter=TRUE, classProbs = T)

trCtr_none <- trainControl(method = "none", classProbs = T)

```
=
## Setup parallel computing

```{r, cache = T}
cl <- makeCluster(7)
registerDoParallel(cl)

```

## Get model info if needed

```{r, cache = T}
getModelInfo()$xgbTree$parameters

```

## Choose Hyperparameters

```{r, cache = T}
C5.0grid <- expand.grid(.trials = c(1:9, (1:10)*10),
                       .model = c("tree", "rules"),
                       .winnow = c(TRUE, FALSE))

SVMgrid <- expand.grid(sigma = c(0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.2),
                       C= c(seq(0,1,0.2),10,500))

XGBgrid <- expand.grid(nrounds = 100, # Fixed. depend on datasize
                       max_depth = 6, # More will make model more complex and more likely to overfit. Choose only this due to computational barrier
                       eta = c(0.01,0.05, 0.1), # NEED FINE TUNE
                       gamma = 0, # it is usually OK to leave at 0
                       min_child_weight = c(1,2,3), # The higher value, the more conservative model is, NEED FINE TUNE
                       colsample_bytree = c(.4, .7, 1), # subsample by columns
                       subsample = 1) # subsample by row leave at 1 since we doing k-fold

rpartgrid <- expand.grid(cp = runif(30,0,0.5))

rfgrid <- expand.grid(mtry = 1:8)

```


## Train models

Choose predictors  

```{r}

formula <- as.formula(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Title +
                        Age + MissingAge + SibSp + Parch + Groupsize +
                        Fare + Embarked)

```

We will use caret ensemble for easy training

```{r}
set.seed(67659)

modelList <- caretList(
  formula, data = train,
  trControl=trCtr_grid,
  metric = "ROC",
  tuneList=list(
    rf=caretModelSpec(method="rf", tuneGrid= rfgrid),
    SVM=caretModelSpec(method="svmRadial", tuneGrid = SVMgrid,
                       preProcess = c("scale", "center")),
    xgb=caretModelSpec(method="xgbTree", tuneGrid = XGBgrid),
    rpart= caretModelSpec(method = "rpart", tuneGrid = rpartgrid),
    C5.0 = caretModelSpec(method = "C5.0", tuneGrid = C5.0grid)
    )
)
```

# Evaluation

## Evaluate in train data

```{r}
dotplot(resamples(modelList))
```

- rpart seems to be the worst model.

Let's see if there is any significant different between them

```{r}
diff(resamples(modelList), metric = "ROC") %>% summary()
```

- from here we can see that rpart and SVM are actually worse than the rest of models.

Any correlation between models

```{r}
modelCor(resamples(modelList))
```

- all model are all correlated, which might not results in any improvement when trying to ensemble models. This is not unexpected as those model are quite strong. So we will not use any ensemble for now.

Let's have a look at Importance of predictors in tree-based model

```{r}
ggplot(varImp(modelList$rf)) + labs(title = "Random Forest") +
ggplot(varImp(modelList$C5.0)) + labs(title = "C5.0") +
ggplot(varImp(modelList$xgb)) + labs(title = "XGB") +
ggplot(varImp(modelList$rpart)) + labs(title = "rpart")

```

MissingAge predictors does not seem to do well across most models, in contrast, Groupsize perform really well.

<br>

Let's visualize a tree in rpart model

```{r}
plot(as.party(modelList$rpart$finalModel))
```

What a simple tree that can achieve almost 80% accuracy on unseen data (next part)

## Evaluate in holdout data

Accuracy check:

```{r}

map(modelList, ~predict(., newdata = holdout)) %>%
  map( ~ confusionMatrix(holdout$Survived, .)) %>%
  map_df(~.$overall["Accuracy"])

```

ROC and AUC

```{r, warning = F}
modROC <- map(modelList, ~predict(. , newdata = holdout, type = "prob")) %>%
  map(~roc(predictor = .x$Lived,
           response = holdout$Survived,
           levels = rev(levels(holdout$Survived)),
           print.auc = TRUE)
)

aucROC <- modROC %>% map_df(~.$auc) %>% gather(key = "model", value = "ROC") %>%
  arrange(desc(ROC)) %>%
  mutate(ROC = round(ROC, digits = 3)) %>% unite("auc", model, ROC, sep = "'s AUC: ") %>%
  pull() %>% str_c(collapse = "\n")

ggroc(modROC) + geom_text(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, label = aucROC), color = "black") + scale_color_discrete(name = "Model")


```


Ranking on best performance:

1. C5.0

2. Random Forest

3. Extreme gradient boosting
4. Supportive vector machines

5. Decision tree


## Evaluate on test data

Extract best tunes from models then train them again using all training data with no resampling method. After that, predict data on test data and print csv out to put on kaggle

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(6759)

rf_f <- train(formula, data = alltrain, trControl = trCtr_none, method = "rf",
              tuneGrid = modelList$rf$bestTune)

SVM_f <- train(formula, data = alltrain, trControl = trCtr_none, method = "svmRadial",
               tuneGrid = modelList$SVM$bestTune, preProcess = c("scale", "center"))

xgb_f <- train(formula, data = alltrain, trControl = trCtr_none, method = "xgbTree",
               tuneGrid = modelList$xgb$bestTune)

rpart_f <- train(formula, data = alltrain, trControl = trCtr_none, method = "rpart",
                 tuneGrid = modelList$rpart$bestTune)

C5.0_f <- train(formula, data = alltrain, trControl = trCtr_none, method = "C5.0",
                tuneGrid = modelList$C5.0$bestTune)

all <- list(rf = rf_f, SVM = SVM_f, xgb = xgb_f, rpart = rpart_f, C5.0 = C5.0_f)

finaltest <- predict(all, newdata = test, na.action = na.pass)

prefix <- "all_ROC"

for (i in names(finaltest)){
  bind_cols(PassengerID = test0$PassengerId, Survived = finaltest[[i]]) %>%
    mutate(Survived = fct_recode(Survived, "1" = "Lived", "0" = "Died")) %>%
    write_csv(str_c("./prediction/", prefix,"_" ,i,"_", today(), ".csv"))
}

```

Results are

- Extreme Gradient Boosting at 0.77990

- Supportive Vector Machines at 0.78947

- Random Forest at 0.76555

- C5.0 at 0.78468

- Single Decision tree at 0.77511

# Using other set of predictors

Let's see if we can improve the results from test set by using other set of predictors on to train on all data available

```{r, eval = FALSE}

formula1 <- as.formula(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Title +
                        Groupsize +
                        Fare + Embarked)


set.seed(67659)

                       preProcess = c("scale", "center")),
    xgb=caretModelSpec(method="xgbTree", tuneGrid = XGBgrid),

- Supportive vector machine: 0.79904

- Random Forest: 0.80382

- Single decision tree: 0.77511

We can see a significant increase in accuracy using Random Forest with less predictors hence less overfitting. A slight improvement can be observed in other models except for C5.0

- Single decision tree: 0.77511

# Summary

We can see easily that women and children were the priority of rescue. First class has higher chance of surviving compare to other classes.

I used a lot of machine learning algorithms for this project, I believe that XGBoost can be fine tuned more to obtain better result. <br> The highest result gave me top 9% on Kaggle. However, I think that using complicated blackbox machine learning should be accompanied by other simpler algorithm which allows easy understanding for human.
